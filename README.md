### S3D

This is the repository for our 'Utilizing Weak Supervision to Create S3D: A Sarcasm Annotated Dataset' workshop paper submitted to EMNLP 2022. This repository includes our manually and annotated SAD dataset along with both versions of our weakly supervised S3D dataset. Both of these tweet datasets can be used for the purpose of training sarcasm detection models.

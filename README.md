# S3D: A Weakly Supervised Sarcasm Dataset

This is the repository for our 'Utilizing Weak Supervision to Create S3D: A Sarcasm Annotated Dataset' workshop paper submitted to the EMNLP NLP+CSS 2022 workshop. This repository includes our manually annotated SAD dataset along with both versions of our weakly supervised S3D dataset. Both of these twitter datasets can be used for the purpose of training sarcasm detection models.
